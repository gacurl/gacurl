# Hi, I'm Greg.

## I **love** coffee and learning to `code`.

Thanks for stopping by. I build aircraft carriers while learning Web Development with **[#VetsWhoCode](https:https://vetswhocode.io/)**.

#### Talking about personal stuff
I'm a Dad, husband, and US Navy veteran. I wake each day to get a _little_ bit better. I feel most fulfilled when I am learning, building a team, or helping others succeed.  

When not building ships or code, I enjoy traveling, reading, and being outdoors.  

I intend to step foot on every continent.

As for books, I enjoy sending meaningful books that _impacted_ me to friends and colleagues.

[Here's](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/37345834?ref=nav_mybooks "Goodreads list") what I'm reading.
