# Hi, I'm Greg.

## I like coffee and code.

![Cup of coffee!](https://github.com/gacurl/gacurl/blob/master/cupa.jpg?raw=true) Nectar of the Gods



I'm learning Web Development with **VetsWhoCode**.

I'm a Dad,  
a husband,  
and a US Navy veteran.  

I spend my time getting a _little_ bit better each day.  

My passions are:  
- learning,
- building teams,
- and helping others succeed.
