# Hi, I'm Greg.

## I **love** coffee and learning to `code`.

Thanks for stopping by. I build aircraft carriers while learning Web Development with **[#VetsWhoCode](https:https://vetswhocode.io/)**.

#### Talking about personal stuff
I'm a Dad, husband, and US Navy veteran. I wake each day to get a _little_ bit better. I feel most fulfilled when I am learning, building a team, or helping others succeed.  

When not building ships or `code`, I enjoy traveling, reading, and being outdoors.

I intend to step foot on every continent. Here's where I've been so far.

As for books, I enjoy reads that stimulate emotion as well as learning. No particular genre suits more than another, so bring 'em all. I've been known to sending meaningful books that _impacted_ me to friends and colleagues.

[Here's what I'm reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/37345834?ref=nav_mybooks "Goodreads list") at Goodreads.

Spending time away from the screen gives thoughts time to anchor. Get away for a spell and try again later.
