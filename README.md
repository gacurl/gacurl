# Hi, I'm Greg.

** I **love** coffee and learning to `code`.

Thanks for stopping by. I build aircraft carriers while learning Web Development with **[#VetsWhoCode](https:https://vetswhocode.io/)**.

#### Talking about personal stuff
I'm a Dad, husband, US Navy veteran. I wake each day to get a _little_ bit better.  

My passions are:  
- learning,
- building teams, and 
- helping others succeed.
